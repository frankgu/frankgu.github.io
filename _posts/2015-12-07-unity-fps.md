# Techniques
## Models
I used blender to create all the models (map/target/soldier/gun) in this game, the soldier&gun models were downloaded from the previous youtube link.

## Character movement
The Character movement was mainly controlled by the **Character Motor Script**, user could set the moving parameters in this script.

## Character animations
I had four difference kinds of animation for the soldier character in this project, they were Forward, Backward, Left and Right animation.

## Inverse Kinematic
The inverse kinematic in this project was handled by a free version package in the unity store and only the left & right elbow of the soldier character applied the inverse kinematic in order to make the characterâ€™s arms moved more intuitively.

## Collision
I had two kinds of collision in the project the first one was the mesh collision which applied between the soldier & map and the soldier & target, the second collision was handled by the **physics.raycast** function in unity, this collision was for detecting the bullet collision.

## Particle system
This project used the build in particle system package in unity. This package was in Assets -> Import Package -> ParticleSystems
