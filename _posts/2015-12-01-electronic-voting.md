In this project, the system uses the Canadian electoral system which is based on a parliamentary system of government. The people in each electoral district vote for a candidate of their choice. The candidate who receives the most votes becomes Members of Parliament (MP) for that electoral district. There are 308 electoral districts in Canada. After an election, the party with the most elected representatives becomes the party in power. The Prime Minister is the leader of the political party with the most elected Members of Parliament.
