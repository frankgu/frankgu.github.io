# Background

This project is a Ruby on Rails API server example for a tutoring APP (have not developed yet). There are two different kind of users in this project, Tutor and Student. Student can make an appointment request to tutor and tutor can reply to student in realtime. Once tutor accept the appointment, both student and tutor will enter a video conference room (using Twilio) within several seconds and they can talk to each other for several minutes. After that, student need to pay for this appointment and both student and tutor give reviews to each other.
